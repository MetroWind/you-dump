= You-dump

A naively simple web UI for youtube-dl/yt-dlp

== Introduction

You-dump is an extremely simple web UI. It just allows the user to
queue up URLs to download, and see if a previously queued download is
finished or not. Nothing more. It does not even persist the queue and
the finished downloadsâ€”these are cleared with a restart.

== Deployment

The simplicity has one major benefit: this program is very easy to
deploy. In order for it to run, one just needs to installed the
following:

* The compiled binary (`cargo build --release`)
* A configuration file at `/etc/you-dump.toml`
* A directory that stores the front-end static files. Copy the files
  in the `static` directory in the repo into this directory.
* Optionally a systemd service file (or equivalent)
* Optionally a reverse proxy

The program itself does not write anything to disk at all.

In the future I may make this simpler by compiling the static files
into the library. These are just two files anyway.

The configuration file contains the following lines:

----
# Video will be downloaded into this directory. This should exist.
download_dir = "/tmp"
# The executable of youtube-dl/yt-dlp
ydl_exec = "yt-dlp"
# The directory that stores the static files
static_dir = "/var/lib/you-dump/static"
listen_address = "127.0.0.1"
listen_port = 8000
# Whether to write timestamps in the log
log_timestamp = false
# Extra arguments passed to youtube-dl/yt-dlp. Omit to pass no extra
# args.
extra_args = ["--windows-filenames"]
----

If you are using a reverse proxy, you can choose to host the static
files in the proxy. Make sure they are served under the `static` path.
In that case the `static_dir` line can be omitted in the configuration
file. But it is also perfectly fine to let you-dump handle the static
files.

You could choose to let systemd manage the service. In that case here
is a minimal service file:

----
[Unit]
Description=You-dump service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=you_dump
Group=you_dump
ExecStart=/usr/bin/you-dump
Environment="RUST_LOG=info"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
